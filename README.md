## Linear Mixed Effects Modeling for Assessing Hospital Impact on Substance Use Disorder

This first quarter century witnessed a considerable rise in drug-relate overdoses with the nation's medical institutions taking on a significant share of the burden. Medical hospitals employ a wide range of methods to combat substance-use related overdose including methods seeing growing utilization including Nalaxone administration, short-term psychiatric commitment, inpatient detox, and opioid replacement therapies such as methadone and subutex. The present exploratory analysis reveals the nuanced relationship between socioeconomic factors and drug-overdoses by explicitly modeling the nested structure of counties in Hospital Referal Regions. We then examine how geographic differences in hospital performance may dampen or exacerbate level 1 effects. We investigate two critical hypotheses, (1) whether poor socioeconomic conditions and income inequality correspond to decreasing drug overdoses, and (2) whether the quantity of SUDs services available in HRRs moderates these relationships which are presumed negative.

The analysis is separated into two stages, (1) a thorough cleaning and merging of several national datasets and (2) the analysis which relies mostly on linear mixed effects models.

### Data Used
The analysis merges several public and private datasets. These primarily include US census data for the unit-level (counties), and American Hospital Survey data for the cluster-level (HRRs).
